Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  Looking at the probability, the vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  Slope is not zero based on the coefficients of the independent variables.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
   The intercept is statistically significant. Other variables and factors the probably contribute to the variation in the mpg may or may not be within our dataset and will need to be collected or observed



Suspension Coil Summary
	
Mean: 1498.78
Median: 1500
var(PSI): 62.29356
sd(PSI): 7.892627

The mean and median are almost the same. The variance is within the design specification that it must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Based on this data, it does meet the current manufacturing design specification

Suspension Coil T-Test
psi_1500 <- suspensionpsi %>% filter(PSI==1500) #select only data points where PSI = 1500
> View(psi_1500)
> t.test((psi_1500$PSI),(suspensionpsi$PSI)) #compare sample versus population means

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  (psi_1500$PSI) and (suspensionpsi$PSI)
t = 1.8931, df = 149, p-value = 0.06028
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.05340272  2.49340272
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
  1500.00   1498.78 

The zero hypothesis holds true that there is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its presume population mean. The p-values is greater than the significance level of 0.05 percent. Hence the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and the two means are statistically similar


Design Your Own Study
 To compare the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market, the following metrics collection would be useful and of interest to a consumer:
  a. Cost
  b. Fuel Efficiency
  c. Color Options
  f. Horse Power
  g. Braking System
  h. AWD
  i. SUV
  j. Number of Passengers
  k. Leather Seats
  l. Engine (4 cycl, 6 cylc)
  m. Powertrain
  n. Autobraking
  o. Lane Departure Warning
  p. Head on Collission Warning
  q. Airbags
  r. Rear View Camera
  s. Navigation System
  t. Phone connectivity
  u. Climate Control
  v. Audio System
  w. Model Year
  x. Rating
  y. Sales

Queston to ask would be how the MechaCar prototype compares with the other vehicles. The two sample t-test can be applied here. The null hypothesis is there is no statiscal difference between the two observed sample means. The alternate hypotheis is there is a statistical difference between the two observed sample means
